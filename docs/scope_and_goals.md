# Scope and Goals
This project is a **study tool** and **exploratory side project**. Errors are possible, and limitations (see below) are expected.

## Primary Goals
- Organize knowledge about FH-deficient renal cell carcinoma (FHRCC) mechanisms
- Serve as a learning tool for understanding how metabolic, epigenetic, and signaling pathways interact following FH loss (and developing familiarity with knowledge graphs (KGs))
- Practice encoding causal assumptions and uncertainty
- Practice building a clean, extensible scientific tool that non-experts can use

The KG is not meant to provide definitive answers or causal relationships.

## Intended Use
- Personal study and conceptual clarification
- Communicate mechanisms in easier-to-comprehend manner
- Demonstrate how biology can be translated into technical tools

Paths through the KG should be interpreted as possible explanations or observations, not predictions or truth.

## Non-Goals
This project does **not** aim to:
- Be a comprehensive or exhaustive representation of FHRCC biology
- Automatically extract knowledge from text
- Serve as a clinical decision-support system
- Predict outcomes, pronosis, or treatment response
- Replace primary literature or expert knowledge
- Provide effect sizes or probabilities


## Example Limitations
- Incomplete knowledge: The KG reflects a subset of current understanding, which may be outdated, biased, or incorrect.
- Literature bias: Well-studied pathways with multiple references (e.g. HIF, NRF2) may be overrepresented.
- Context loss: cell-type specificity, timing, and dosage effects are simplified
